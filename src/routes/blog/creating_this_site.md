## Intro
The whole thing of creating my personal website started when I discovered [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & It's "Meta-Framework" [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). I really enjoyed working and experimenting with Svelte and decided to create my own website to see how it would turn out.

## Getting-Started
My framework of choice for creating this website was Svelte because of several reasons:

- Proper markup syntax compared to `JSX`.
- It's actually nice to use and the structure of the code is really easy to understand.
- It's logical defaults such as scoped styling makes styling easy to implement.
- Has a good extension for VS Code with linting which has features like removing unused styles and warns the user about accessibility; For eg: When `img` tags don't have an `alt` attribute.

For the design of the site I wanted to emulate the clean and simple layout of [overreacted.io](overreacted.io) but I also wanted to add some extra pages.

## Why SvelteKit?
I decided to go towards the direction of SvelteKit compared to Svelte because of support for Hot Module Reloading(HMR), Server-Side-Rendering (SSR), code-splitting & file-system based routing. It also has support for static-site generation for fast load times.

## Creating pages


## Conclusion
I really liked the experience of working with svelte on this project and going forward It is my default framework for creating web related projects.
